Hello and Welcome to Teddy's Haunted House Game!

*** Note ***

This is a pilot of the game and many features are yet to be added. However, the premise of the game remains the same!

*** Objective ***

The objective of the game is to travel throughout the Haunted House and uncover its secrets. You must visit all the locations in one floor before advancing to the next. But don't rush! If you don't stay on your toes or you aren't careful, you may miss an important detail, or worse, you may die! At the same time, you will also die if you run out of energy!

Once you get to the attic, you will be tested by the ghost Lucretia on whether you deserved entry into her home. 

Best of luck!
