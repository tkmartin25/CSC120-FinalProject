This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.

*** Functions ***

    "enter" - You will use this to enter the Haunted House and start playing.

    User.go(direction) - You will use this function to move around the Haunted House. 
        
        There are six possible directions to go:
            
            1. "up" - use this direction to go up the stairs to get to the floor above you.

            2. "down" - use this direction to go down the stairs to get to the floor below you.

            3. "a" - use a to go to the space left of you. 

            4. "d" - use d to go to the space right of you.

            5. "w" - use w to go towards the back of the house. (You can imagine this as the "up" arrow key.)

            6. "s" - use a to go towards the front of the house. (You can imagine this as the "down" arrow key.)
    
    "write" - You can use this to write in your notebook to help you keep track of information. But be warned! You're writing with a pen and will only have [insert here] pages, so be wise with your notes.

    "read" - You can use this to see what you've written in your notebook. The page number will be what page you want to read. The notebook starts at page 1 and ends at page 5.
